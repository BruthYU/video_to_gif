# video_to_gif
## A web program for transforming videos to gif on android phones.  
This program includes a folder and a node.js file.
## Quick Start
### Local test
Open cmd and start the node.js service by
```
nodejs hello.js
```
Then open index2.html to browse the page.
### On mobile phones
You need to change line 128 in index2.html
```javascript
url: 'http://localhost:3000/upload',
```
Change localhost to your own ip.(Simply you can put your desktop and your phone in the same VLAN by using hotspot).  
And then do the same things as local test.
